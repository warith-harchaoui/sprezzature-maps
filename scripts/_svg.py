"""
_svg — tiny, output-identical SVG primitives shared by the make_* generators.

Every ``make_<id>.py`` generator hand-writes its SVG as f-strings. A
handful of primitives recurred verbatim across three or more of them and
are the *only* things factored out here, because each can be made
byte-for-byte identical to the inline code it replaces:

* :func:`xml_escape` — the three-``replace`` XML-metacharacter escape
  (``&`` → ``&amp;``, ``<`` → ``&lt;``, ``>`` → ``&gt;``) that ~11
  generators defined privately as ``_xml`` / ``_esc``.
* :func:`point_on_circle` — the polar-to-Cartesian point
  ``(cx + r*cos(theta), cy + r*sin(theta))`` (``theta`` already in
  radians) that several circular-layout generators (chord, windrose,
  radviz, speaking-time) spelled out inline.
* :func:`fmt_compact` — the ``f"{v:.1f}".rstrip("0").rstrip(".")``
  path-data float formatter that the streamgraph, difference-chart and
  bollinger generators each carried as a private ``_fmt``.
* :func:`catmull_rom_beziers` — the Catmull-Rom → cubic-Bézier ``C``
  command run those same three generators carried as a private
  ``_catmull_rom``. The caller passes its own formatter so the emitted
  string stays byte-identical (streamgraph/difference-chart/bollinger
  all pass :func:`fmt_compact`).
* :func:`hex_to_rgb` — the ``#RRGGBB`` → ``(r, g, b)`` int triple that
  the hexbin-map, binned-grid-map and circle-packing generators each
  spelled out as a private ``_hex_to_rgb``.
* :func:`svg_open` — the responsive, accessible ``<svg ...>`` root tag
  (explicit width/height, a matching ``viewBox`` so the graphic scales
  fluidly, the house font, and ``role``/``aria-labelledby`` wiring) that
  ~46 generators opened their document with verbatim. Only the exact
  shared template is emitted; generators whose root uses a different
  attribute order (e.g. andrews, which leads with ``aria-label``) keep
  their inline tag, so every adoption stays byte-identical.

Deliberately *not* extracted: the per-element hover/tooltip wrappers
(the ``<g tabindex=…><title>…`` blocks and their ``:hover`` CSS) and the
pill-label backgrounds. Those differ in class names, ARIA wiring, and
rounding across generators, so a shared helper could not be made
output-identical without editing rendered bytes — which the DRY refactor
must never do. Callers keep their own float formatting; these helpers
only return the raw string / floats the inline code produced.

Other tempting-but-rejected candidates (kept inline because they fail
either the rule of three *or* the byte-identical test): the annular
arc/sector path (rose == radial-bar only — two callers); the ``_polar``
clock-bearing helpers (behaviour splits by signature and all already
delegate to :func:`point_on_circle`); the Equal-Earth map projection
(spike-map and hexbin-map differ, and windbarb is equirectangular); the
flow-ribbon paths (three unrelated implementations); the sequential
colour ramp (hexbin vs binned differ in stops, gamma and light anchor);
and the ``convex_hull`` scan (only one of these generators uses it).

The module is **stdlib-only** — it imports nothing but :mod:`math` — so
it stays importable everywhere ``_style.py`` is (no dataviz tier needed).

    Nearly every ``make_<id>.py`` generator opens its document with the *same*
    root element: an explicit ``width``/``height`` for a sensible intrinsic
    size, a ``viewBox="0 0 width height"`` so the graphic scales fluidly to any

    that follows into one accessible name for screen readers. The ``<title>``
    also surfaces as the browser's native hover tooltip.

    This returns exactly the string those generators assembled inline, so
    adopting it leaves the rendered bytes unchanged. The ``<title>`` and

    width : object
        Canvas width in user-space pixels. Stringified as-is (an ``int`` prints
        without a decimal point), matching the inline ``f"{width}"``.
    height : object
        Canvas height in user-space pixels. Stringified as-is.
    title_id : str
        The ``id`` of the ``<title>`` element the caller emits next (e.g.
        ``"vn-title"``); becomes the first token of ``aria-labelledby``.
    desc_id : str
        The ``id`` of the ``<desc>`` element (e.g. ``"vn-desc"``); the second
        ``aria-labelledby`` token.
    font_family : str, optional
        CSS font stack for the whole document. Defaults to the house stack
        ``"Roboto, system-ui, sans-serif"``; pass a different string for the
        (few) generators that inject their own.
    embed_fonts : bool, optional
        When true (the default), the returned string also carries a
        ``<defs><style>@font-face…</style></defs>`` block embedding the
        bundled Roboto + Roboto Mono WOFF2 faces as base64 data URIs (see
        ``sprezzature_figures.fonts``), so the SVG renders the house
        typography correctly wherever it is opened -- no dependency on the
        viewer having Roboto installed. Pass ``False`` for a lighter,
